#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script displays lines containing the word "bash" and finds the PID
# of the current Bash process.


# Use ps to list all processes, and grep to filter lines containing
# the word "bash"
ps auxf | grep bash

# shellcheck disable=SC2009
# Explanation: The above line disables the SC2009 ShellCheck warning for
# using 'ps | grep'. 
# We can safely disable this warning since we are aware of how it's being
# used in this specific script.
